# LeetCode üé≤

## Description üìù

This repository was created to store the solutions to LeetCode challenges that I have solved over time. For the past few months, I have been trying to develop the habit of solving at least one problem per day, with the goal of keeping my problem-solving and algorithm-building skills sharp.

Although I try to be consistent, I am not always able to solve a problem every day. Sometimes the challenges are too difficult and require more time and effort than I can dedicate at the moment. Other times, lack of time or even laziness get in the way. Still, I try to keep up the practice, as I believe that consistency is the key to continuous improvement.

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Not all solutions in this repository were developed entirely by me**. In some cases, I have enlisted the help of artificial intelligence or more experienced users of the platform to understand the logic behind certain problems. Whenever possible, I try to adapt and understand the solutions found so that I can learn from them.

**I would like to make it clear that not all solutions here are my own**. This repository serves primarily as a record of my progress and learning, and not as a collection of 100% original solutions.
